## JSOnline.com Projects Footer

Place the following code snippet where you'd like the footer to be on the page.

#### Preferred method:
```
<script id="footer-script" src="footer.js" 
    data-first-link=""
    data-first-headline=""
    data-first-image=""
    data-first-desc=""
    data-second-link=""
    data-second-headline=""
    data-second-image=""
    data-second-desc="">
</script>
```
*^ This assumes that the Futura fonts are already loaded on the page and that you have a mobile friendly viewport set. If not, see the readme.html file.*
